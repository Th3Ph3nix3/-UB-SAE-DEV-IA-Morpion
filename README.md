# AI Project for \( N \times N \) Tic-Tac-Toe with \( K \) Pieces to Align

## Project Description

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game where two players take turns placing their pieces on a grid. The objective is to align a specified number of pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. In this project, we have extended the traditional game to an \( N \times N \) grid and introduced the ability to specify the number \( K \) of pieces required to win.

## Features

- **Configurable Grid**: Play on an \( N \times N \) grid, where \( N \) can be defined by the user.
- **Number of Pieces to Align**: Specify the number \( K \) of pieces needed to win.
- **Pattern-Based AI**: The AI uses patterns to evaluate the best possible moves and maximize its chances of winning.
- **Simple User Interface**: A command-line interface to interact with the AI and play the game.
